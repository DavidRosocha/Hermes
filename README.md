# Hermes - Campus Marketplace App

## Overview
**Hermes** is a campus-focused marketplace app designed to simplify buying, selling, and renting items among students. Unlike traditional marketplace apps that cater to city-wide communities, Hermes creates a localized platform tailored for students, ensuring convenience and efficiency within the campus environment.
